## Description
The website has plenty of design and interactive features. The landing page initializes with an attractive background. The order section is includes a carousel for interactivity and enables users to select their pizza preferences. On clicking "place-order", the user is directed to a checkout section, where they choose whether or not they want a delivery at an extra cost. The contact section includes a message area for a user's input if found necessary; it also includes contact and address information for the company. In the fourth column, is a Google maps embed, which directs users to the company location. Two small gifs are included in the contact section for interactivity.
